## üìï TILed

**TILed is medium to share your day to day learning with the world.**

---

### Motivation ü§î

We learn a lot of new things in our day to day life, be it in code reviews, developing your cool side projects or features in office projects. The idea of TILed is to share that learning with the world without switching context between the medium you got introduced to that learning and sharing it with others.

This project is inspired by [shawn wang](https://twitter.com/swyx)'s [tweet](https://twitter.com/swyx/status/1009174159690264579) about **Learning in Public**. Share your learnings with others, no matter how short it is, it'll be beneficial to someone, for sure.

As of now the medium to compose TIL is Visual Studio Code Editor, and it can be shared via Github Gist. Future plans are to create a personal feed and share it on multiple platforms like Twitter or any platform which exposes APIs to create Posts.
